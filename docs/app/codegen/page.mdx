# Telchar Codegen Library

## Overview

Telchar Codegen is a Rust library that generates boilerplate code for different languages and libraries, allowing developers to build txs that interact with on-chain protocols directly, without having to deal directly with the implementation details of each one.

## Installation

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

```sh
cargo add telchar
```

Or add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
telchar = "0.1.0"
```
