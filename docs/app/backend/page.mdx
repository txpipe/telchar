## Backend

The backend is a GraphQL server that allows querying and managing DApps. It enables listing all available DApps, retrieving details of a specific DApp, and searching for DApps by name.

Each DApp is associated with a blueprint, which includes key metadata such as its description, version, license, and more. Additionally, every blueprint has a set of validators and schemas that define its structure and validation rules.

This backend provides a flexible and efficient way to access DApp-related data, ensuring developers can fetch exactly what they need with minimal overhead.

For more details on the available queries and data structures, you can refer to the GraphQL schema [here](/backend/schema).
