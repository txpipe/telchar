# Welcome!

Telchar will be a toolchain that improves the developer experience of integrating Plutus validators in off-chain processes. We'll leverage the information provided in blueprint files (CIP-57) to improve on two areas: discovery and codegen (code generation).

- discovery: we'll implement a public registry of validator interfaces, allowing authors and 3rd-parties to discover and integrate on-chain protocols easily.
- codegen: the toolchain will include a mechanism to generate boilerplate code for different languages and libraries, allowing developers to build txs that interact with on-chain protocols directly, without having to deal directly with the implementation details of each one.
